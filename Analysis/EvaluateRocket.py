# PROVIDE A DATA-BASED EVALUATION OF A SIMULATED ROCKET
# Based on instantaneous conditions at every time frame, the script will calculate optimal coefficients/values and measure the distance away from them that we are



# Easier safety factors

# Fin flutter safety; should be easy

# Max Q

# Max g-force


# I think there is some way to do this with ballistic coefficient. I just want an indicator of how close we are to the best possible mass for a time


# I want to have something in here for stability. Maybe I will ask that the CP is as close to the CG as possible divided by moment of inertia


# I guess I could import the Goddard problem solver and determine how close our thrust curve is to the best thrust curve for a flight of otherwise identical dimensions.
# It will be hard to make this work for variable mass ox tank. I guess I could just assume O/F based mass drain matched to the thrust profile
