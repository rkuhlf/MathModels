PCAPS ISFS 1 second data
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/233.003

Summary
This dataset contains one second values for variables measured by the 7 NCAR
ISFS stations during PCAPS. Variables that were recorded at rates faster than
1 Hz, namely u, v and spd from sonic anemometers, have been averaged to 1
second. Radiation and soil variables that were recorded at approximately 1/5
Hz will have missing values interspersed with measured values. The data was
collected from November 10, 2010 to February 2, 2011.
