### A Brief Note about Goddard
This is for the Goddard 2021-2022 program. Mr. McLeod is the teacher.

# Rocket Simulation

## Calculation Components

### Thrust

### Drag Force
Causes rotation

### Angular Drag Force

### Gravitational Pull

## Visualization
Most graphing is done using MatPlotLib.

Exported to blender to make cool video.

## Unfortunate Eccentricities
There are a few artifacts in my code due to my programming environment.

I frequently use *import sys \ sys.path.append(".")*. This is because when Visual Studio Code runs a file in a folder, it doesn't include the project folder for imports (at least it doesn't on my computer). That code adds it.
