# NOSE CONE DESIGN
# A nose cone is literally just a mass object
# Unless I want to punish myself by implementing the barrowman equations, I will only need design-oriented functions here
# So, this is a lot of things for construction and length calculations, as well as weight and CG that could easily be done by CAD
