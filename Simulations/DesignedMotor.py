# SIMULATE THE MOTOR I DESIGNED FOR MMR
# Unfortunately, I am going to have to just specify chamber pressure as constant
# With that inaccuracy, I am not even going to bother making any monte carlo style optimizers


# TODO: rewrite the motor and simulation and logger classes so that this will be relatively easy. I will probably have to make the current simulation a subclass for rocket, and the feedbacklogger into a rocketlogger
