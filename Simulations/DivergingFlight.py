# SIMULATE ITERATIVELY TO DETERMINE STABILITIES FOR DIVERGING FLIGHT
# Calculate based on a constant stability margin through the flight
# I believe that you should only get actually diverging flight once you start decelerating. 
# Then, the restorative force begins to decay and any oscillations will start to expand in amplitude
